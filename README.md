# ALGO-VISUALIZER

An interactive representation of some search and maze generation algorithms.

Features:
- Start, stop and resuming of the algorithms
- Real time walls drawing during algorithm execution
- Repositioning (dragging) of the Alien (start) and Diamond (end) icons
- Light / dark theme
- Traversing speed adjustment

Currently implemented algorithms:
- A*
- Depth First Search
- Breath First Search
- Dijkstra
